# Development-of-IoT-and-VLC-based-Smart-Streetlight-System

This paper proposes an IoT and VLC-based smart streetlight system. The proposed system can collect various environmental information using IoT sensers, and utilize a deep learning model to decide whether streetlight turn-on or not. Besides, the decided results and environmental data are stored in a database and can be monitored through a web site whenever. Additionally, the proposed system can exchange streetlight information using VLC. From the performance evaluation, the proposed system  shows that the deep learning model effectively decides whether streetlights turn-on or not.
